        Oakridge Model United Nations is a three-day international relations simulation for high school students, held on Oakridge’s campus in Bangalore. At OakMUN, delegates from all over the world interact with one another through debate and diplomacy to solve complex challenges facing the world today. At OakMUN, delegates will have the opportunity to take on roles of UN representatives, policymakers, and important figures and learn about the inner workings of global politics and problem-solving. By engaging in topics concerning international and national security, political and economic development, human rights, sustainability, and more, delegates learn to navigate the intricacies of international negotiation and teamwork, adopt new perspectives, and develop comprehensive resolutions on pressing global issues.
<br/><br/>
This year, OakMUN will strive to provide delegates from across the country with an opportunity to participate in a dynamic, educational, and enriching opportunity to hone in and showcase their abilities. This passion, commitment, and care makes OakMUN one of the premier global Model UN conferences.
