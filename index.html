                    <h3>Letter from the Director General</h3>
                    <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
                    <p>

                        As your Director General, I am incredibly proud and honored to welcome you to our first-ever
                        international conference, the SEAMEI Oakridge Model United Nations 2025!
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Planning this conference, we had one goal: to empower each and every delegate to voice their
                        opinions and demonstrate their strength on the global stage. OAKMUN strives to become a haven
                        for debate, diplomacy, and strength, with a worldwide vision to empower delegates.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        This edition, OAKMUN is reaching new heights with 10 flagship committees, each designed to
                        address key global challenges — from tackling the advent of cryptocurrency to navigating the
                        complex waters of the ongoing global conflict between Israel and Hamas. Diplomacy between world
                        leaders is of utmost importance to successfully craft a solution. Delegates, it is your time to
                        rise, show your strength on the global stage, and dominate the competition. OAKMUN is more than
                        just a conference — it is an oasis for delegates to simulate true democracy, learning from one
                        another and from the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Seeing this conference come to fruition from scratch has been a truly remarkable experience. My
                        first conference, over four years ago, remains one of the most vivid memories I have — being the
                        Delegate of New Zealand in the World Health Organization. That moment, giving my first opening
                        speech, sparked an interest in debate, dialogue and diplomacy that has impacted every aspect of
                        my life since. My mission with this conference is to inspire and impact each delegate that walks
                        through those front doors, creating opportunities to learn and moments to remember.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Our entire secretariat has worked tirelessly over several months to create a truly memorable,
                        enjoyable, and educational conference where delegates from all around the world can showcase
                        their immense skill and diplomacy in solving some of the world’s largest problems. Our Executive
                        Board brings immense experience, knowledge, and passion to take charge in every committee and
                        become an example for every delegate out there.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To the first-time delegates, we are giving you a voice, we are giving you a stage, and we are
                        giving you an audience. OAKMUN is your realm, where you can project strength, determination, and
                        compassion with the aim of learning, engaging, and winning.

                    <h3>Letter from the Secretary General</h3>
                    <p>The world holds its breath as the curtains open for an event beyond mere comparison. This year,
                        at SEAMEI OAKMUN 2025, we do not gather here just for the sake of “debate.” We gather to instill
                        voices in the unheard. It’s a distinct honor to serve as your secretary general for the
                        conference this year.
                        Have you ever felt invisible? Overlooked even though you had that fire in your words? Left with
                        that quiet, heavy guilt that you could have done more, should have done more, but didn’t? Out in
                        the real vast world, that is the culture.Voices are buried, talent goes unnoticed, and history
                        forgets those who remain silent.
                        Not here.
                        <br><br>
                        This conference is, of course, going to focus on confronting global crises, disasters, and
                        threats to all humanity that we cannot afford to ignore. We cannot wait. We cannot stay silent.
                        We cannot leave this room with that same gnawing, stinging regret of “I didn’t do it.”
                        <br><br>

                        In our 10 diverse and unorthodox committees, identities, cultures, powers, and ideologies will
                        clash in ways that can shape nations. Hands shaking, breaths heavy, hearts pounding—well, that
                        is only the great beginning of every story. In the midst of accursed chaos will come resolutions
                        and wars, aid and true alliances, the strongest bonds and the fiercest rivalries. And in those
                        mere groundbreaking moments, your responsibility will be crystal clear. To prevent inordinate
                        catastrophes, to create solutions, to change the course of history, and to reach that ideal idea
                        of “peace.”
                        <br><br>

                        To be seen and to be heard is to be alive. To be invisible is to be erased. Delegates, do not
                        wait for extraordinary luck-filled opportunities; seize the ordinary ones and make them
                        extraordinary. Even if your voice shakes, even if your hands tremble, take the chance.
                        Discipline, research, talent, hard work, or any good quality you may possess won't matter if you
                        do not use it when it really counts. Remember, opportunities multiply as they are seized. You
                        are the voices that will shape the fate of nations, families, and lives. You are the ones who
                        will decide whether the world steps back from the close edge or falls into deep chaos.
                        <br><br>
                        For the delegates of the world, let us begin. Shout until your voice cracks. Strike the table
                        until the sound echoes through the whole landmark. Laugh in the rare, beautiful moments between
                        crises. Protect your stance as if it were your own child. Cry rivers if you must when pressed.
                        Raise your placards even when your hand is half dead. But really, above all, make sure you are
                        heard in the whole damn room.
                        <br><br>

                        This is not a conference for the silent, the hesitant, or the fearful. This is for the voices
                        that won't wait. We have given you the place, the time, and definitely not a spotlight, but
                        brought you the whole sun so your presence can burn bright across every horizon in the room.
                        <br><br>
                        So, delegates, the stage is yours.
                        What will you do now?

                    <p>
                        Dear Delegates,
                        <br><br>
                        After months of anticipation, the stage of SEAMEI OAKMUN 2025 is yours to command. It is my
                        distinct honor to serve as Director-General this year for Oakridge’s first international
                        conference. This conference will provide you delegates with an international forum to engage in
                        professional debate. In a world marked by uncertainty, dialogue and diplomacy are vital for
                        progress.
                        <br><br>
                        We are proud to present our array of ten compelling committees to choose from, giving you the
                        chance to establish your knowledge, calibre and critical thinking. From dynamic crises to
                        thought provoking general assemblies, our committees will demand your leadership and
                        well-informed judgement.
                        <br><br>
                        We strive to make this a rewarding, exciting, and memorable experience for the most important
                        participants in this event- you, the delegates. The expertise of our renowned and articulate
                        executive board members, bring an assurance of thoughtful debate, invaluable guidance and
                        engaging committees.
                        <br><br>
                        MUN is a truly life-changing opportunity to develop your character, skills and confidence, as it
                        did mine. It might be difficult at the start, I’ve been there, hesitating to raise my placard in
                        a huge committee of delegates I’d never met before. But now that I have reached full circle, I’m
                        grateful I did, and I’m confident you will be too. With consistency and a little bit of courage,
                        you’ll find yourself displaying qualities of coherence, collaboration and resourcefulness at
                        this conference.
                        <br><br>
                        Remember, you hold positions of substantial power at this conference, so the choices are yours
                        to make. This is your chance to rise to the occasion, defend your ideas, stick to your stance
                        and embrace this moment to make a difference.
                        <br><br>
                        The floor is yours, delegates. Make it count.
